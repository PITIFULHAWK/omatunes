# omatunes

A native Wayland music player written in Rust, built for [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) / Hyprland rices. Follows the active Omarchy theme automatically — colors update live when you switch themes.

`omatunes` is a customized fork of [sheep-farm/lavanda](https://github.com/sheep-farm/lavanda) by [Balthazzahr](https://github.com/Balthazzahr).

## Key Enhancements & Features

- **Multi-Track Metadata Editing**: Support for bulk editing ID3 tags on multiple selected tracks. Checked fields apply only to selections (or entire albums if toggled). Year tag is fully integrated.
- **Smart Autocomplete Suggestions**: Dynamic pills suggest matching Artists, Albums, and Genres from your library as you type. Editing a field or selecting a suggestion automatically ticks the checkbox.
- **Customizable Track Columns**: Right-click track table headers to customize shown columns and re-order them (Move Left / Move Right). Layouts persist to the library database.
- **Refactored Playlist Views**: Simplified two-tab playlist section:
  - *User Playlists*: Custom folders with the `New Playlist` button placed cleanly at the bottom.
  - *Autoplaylists*: Smart lists (`Liked Songs`, `Recently Played`, `Most Played`) rendered as standard list items.
- **Clean Folder Tabs**: Redesigned Artist/Album/Genre and Playlist tabs to span the full sidebar width with a thin `28px` profile. Features a `4.0` border radius and `0` spacing to prevent anti-aliasing gaps.
- **Upscaled UI Layout**: 20% larger cover art (`216x216` px) with corresponding upscaled player panel typography (Title: 24, Artist/Album: 16).
- **Cover Art Lock**: Album art strictly follows the active playing track instead of changing to selected tracks.
- **Privacy-First Waybar Integration**: Includes a status/statistics script (`scripts/omatunes_text.py`) with all Last.fm network requests stripped. Fetches listening milestones, stats, and leaderboards locally.
- **Audio formats** — MP3, FLAC, OGG, Opus, WAV, AAC, M4A, AIFF and more via [Symphonia](https://github.com/pdeljanov/Symphonia).
- **MPRIS2** — full D-Bus integration; works with `playerctl`, Waybar, AGS, EWW, etc.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Install the Player Binary

#### Option A: Download Pre-compiled Release (Recommended)
Download the pre-compiled binary directly from the latest GitHub release:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -L -o ~/.local/bin/omatunes https://github.com/Balthazzahr/omatunes/releases/latest/download/omatunes
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/omatunes
```

#### Option B: Compile from Source
If you prefer to compile manually:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Balthazzahr/omatunes
cd omatunes
cargo build --release
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp target/release/omatunes ~/.local/bin/omatunes
```

### 2. Install Waybar Integration Scripts
To set up the Waybar module and stats dashboard, copy the scripts to your scripts folder and make them executable:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts
cp scripts/omatunes_text.py ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py
cp scripts/omatunes_volume.sh ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_volume.sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_volume.sh
```

### 3. (Optional) Setup Auto-Sync Service
If you want to push local code edits automatically to your GitHub fork:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts
cp scripts/git_sync.sh ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/git_sync.sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/git_sync.sh

mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp scripts/omatunes-sync.service ~/.config/systemd/user/omatunes-sync.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now omatunes-sync.service
```

---

## Configuration

omatunes generates `~/.config/omatunes/config.toml` on first run. Edit it to configure paths and behaviors:

```toml
# ~/.config/omatunes/config.toml

# Path to your music library
music_dir = "~/Music"

# Initial volume (0.0 = mute, 1.0 = 100%)
volume = 0.8

# Start session with shuffle/repeat
shuffle = false
repeat = false

# Language ("auto", "en", "pt_BR", "es")
language = "auto"

# Seek / Volume steps
seek_step = 5
volume_step = 0.05
```

The library database is stored at `~/.local/share/omatunes/omatunes.db`. If you need to force a full clean re-scan, you can delete this file.

---

## Music Library Syncing

- **Library Location**: `omatunes` reads your music files directly from the directory specified by `music_dir` in your config file (defaults to `~/Music`).
- **Incremental Scanner**: On startup, `omatunes` runs a high-performance incremental scanner. It checks file modification timestamps (`mtime`) to skip unchanged tracks, loading even massive libraries instantly.
- **Auto-Sync Changes**: Any additions, renames, tags modifications, or deletions in your music folder are automatically detected on start and synced to the internal database.

## User Guide & Feature Manual

### 1. Metadata Tag Editing
- **Bulk Selection**: Select a track, then hold `Shift` and click another track to select a group. You can also select non-adjacent files. Press `E` to open the Tag Editor.
- **Smart Fields (Auto-Ticking)**: When you type into any tag input (Title, Artist, Album, Genre, Year, etc.) or click one of the interactive autocomplete pills, the field's checkbox automatically ticks. 
- **Selective Saving**: Only the ticked fields will be updated across all selected files. Unticked fields remain unchanged.
- **Apply to Entire Album**: Check the option at the bottom of the editor to apply your ticked metadata fields to all tracks belonging to the selected album.

### 2. Custom Playlists
- **Access**: Select the **User Playlists** tab on the left sidebar panel to view your playlists.
- **Creation**: Click the **New Playlist** button at the bottom of the list. Type a name and hit enter.
- **Management**: Hover over any custom playlist item to display inline buttons for renaming (pencil icon) or deleting (trash can icon).

### 3. Autoplaylists (Smart Playlists)
- Select the **Autoplaylists** tab on the left sidebar to access automatic lists:
  - **Liked Songs**: Gathers all tracks that you have favorited (starred).
  - **Recently Played**: Automatically lists recently played tracks chronologically.
  - **Most Played**: Lists tracks sorted by play count.
- These lists update live as you listen.

## Waybar Integration

Use the provided script under `/scripts/omatunes_text.py` for Waybar status and hover-tooltip details. 

To connect clicks, add custom commands to the module configuration in `~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc`:

```jsonc
"custom/omatunes": {
    "exec": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py",
    "return-type": "json",
    "format": "{text}",
    "on-click": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py --click left",
    "on-click-right": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py --click right",
    "on-click-middle": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_text.py --click middle",
    "on-scroll-up": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_volume.sh up",
    "on-scroll-down": "~/.local/bin/omatunes_scripts/omatunes_volume.sh down",
    "interval": 2
}
```

## Keybindings

These work when the omatunes window is focused:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` | Play / Pause |
| `→` / `←` | Seek +5s / −5s |
| `n` / `p` | Next / Previous track |
| `s` | Toggle Shuffle |
| `r` | Toggle Repeat |
| `+` or `=` | Volume +5% |
| `-` | Volume −5% |
| `E` | Edit metadata for selected tracks |

---

## Auto-Sync local changes to GitHub
A script is provided at `scripts/git_sync.sh` which watches the local codebase and automatically pushes updates to your GitHub repository in the background.

To activate, ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub, then run:
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now omatunes-sync.service
```
